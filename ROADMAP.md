# Roadmap

This is a list of features in roughly the order they are intended to be implemented, categorized by type.  It is not confirmed that all of them are possible and priority may be changed.

## Data

* Additional columns for item data
  * Item lock reason (rating, rep, class)
  * Item lock reason watermark (specific amount or limit)
  * Item quality (epic, etc)
  * Item type (armor, pattern, pet, mount, cosmetic, reagent)
  * Item status (BoP, etc)
  * Item characteristics (profession, skill, armor type, item level)?
* Options to choose which columns are shown

## Filtering

* Item type filtering
* Filtering by contents of column (epic vs rare)
* Filtering by usable item (profession, armor class, level, already known)
* Filtering by requirement to purchase

## Search

* Search by item name
* Search in other fields

## Long Term

* Classic support (may depend on Blizzard backporting some functionality)
