# Roadmap

This is a list of features in roughly the order they are intended to be implemented.  It is not confirmed that all of them are possible and priority may be changed.

## Initial release

* Extended Cost sorting
* Purchasing and click handling
* Icon and boolean column types (change Available to boolean)

## First feature releases (iterative)

* Additional columns for item data
  * Item lock reason (rating, rep, class)
  * Item lock reason watermark (specific amount or limit)
  * Item quality (epic, etc)
  * Item type (armor, pattern, pet, mount, cosmetic, reagent)
  * Item status (BoP, etc)
  * Item characteristics (profession, skill, armor type, item level)?
* Options to choose which columns are shown
* Item type filtering

## Future feature releases

* Filtering by contents of column (epic vs rare)
* Filtering by usable item (profession, armor class, level, already known)
* Filtering by requirement to purchase
* Search by name

# Long term wishlist

* Search other fields
* Classic support (may depend on Blizzard backporting some functionality)
