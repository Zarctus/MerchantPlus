# About Merchant Plus

This addon will provide a modern update to merchant interfaces in WoW.

You would be able to install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/merchant-plus "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/merchant-plus), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info???-MerchantPlus.html).

## Features

Merchant Plus will provide an additional tab on all WoW merchants, which provides a variety of enhancements:

* Vertical scrollaable format to making finding items in long merchant lists easier
* Searching and filtering functions based on item properties and costs
* Sortable headers based on item properties

An options panel will be provided to configure settings.

## Classic Support

Classic support is tenatively planned but initial support will be limited to Retail. Some of the freatures are based upon functionality only available in the Retail version of the game.

## Compatibility

This addon will not replace the existing UI, so it should not conflict with addons that modify the contents of default Merchant windows, though it also likely will benefit from them.  Addons that replace the entire frame are likely to prevent Merchant Plus from appearing.  Addons that re-skin the merchant frame may result in layout problems.

Ideally, Merchant Plus will not be the cause of any conflicts.  If any are discovered, I'll attempt to fix what I can from the Merchant Plus side.
